Analysing Trends in Citibike NYC Rides
## __Objective__
The project aims to analyze and visualize the trends and patterns in Citibike NYC rides in 2022. The project seeks to identify insights that could help improve the bike-sharing system and can potentially improve the bike-sharing experience for users by making sure the bikes are available and usable.

## **Motivation**
Bicycling has gained popularity as an alternative mode of transportation, and Citibike NYC is one of the largest bike-sharing systems in the world. Analyzing the patterns and trends in Citibike NYC rides could provide insights that could help improve the bike-sharing system and encourage more people to use bicycles as a means of transportation.

## **Executive Summary**

The project analyzed the patterns and trends of Citibike NYC rides in 2022 and identified several key action steps. The most popular round trips were observed to start and end at Central Park and 7th Ave, indicating the need for resource optimization in these areas during peak usage times. Efforts could also be made to promote electric bike services and focus on subscriber retention and acquisition by running appropriate promotions in the peak hours. By analyzing station demand clusters, it was observed that high-demand stations required more frequent servicing and maintenance. Improvements to infrastructure, such as increasing station capacity and optimizing bike availability, could be made in downtown areas with busy stations. Finally, dynamic rebalancing strategies could be employed at stations with a high imbalance of outgoing and incoming bikes to optimize bike availability during peak usage times.
